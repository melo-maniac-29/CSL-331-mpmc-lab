## Overview
This repository provides a collection of resources and examples to help users understand the fundamental principles of microprocessor and microcontroller programming. You’ll find assembly language programs, hardware interfacing examples, and reference materials for:
- **8085 Microprocessor**: Basic programming and interfacing.
- **8086 Microprocessor**: Memory segmentation, addressing modes, and interrupts.
- **8051 Microcontroller**: General-purpose I/O, timers, and interrupt handling.

## Features
- **Extensive Code Examples**: Comprehensive assembly programs for 8085, 8086, and 8051 architectures.
- **Peripheral Interfacing**: Practical examples of interfacing microprocessors with various devices.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Notes on addressing modes, instruction sets, and more for easy reference.
- **Educational Resource**: Designed to support both beginners and advanced learners.

## Requirements
To get started, make sure you have:
- Basic knowledge of microprocessors and assembly language.
- An assembly language editor or emulator (e.g., Keil, MASM, or EMU8086).
- (Optional) Hardware kits or emulators to test programs on physical devices.

## Installation
Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/melo-maniac-29/mpmc.git
cd mpmc
```
Set Up Your Environment:
Open the assembly language files in your preferred editor or emulator. Install any additional dependencies required for specific microcontrollers.

## Usage
The repository is organized by microcontroller type. Explore the directories to find code samples and resources for each processor.
- **8085 Programs**: Located in the `8085/` directory.
- **8086 Programs**: The `8086/` directory includes addressing modes, stack usage, and interrupt handling.
- **8051 Microcontroller**: Access `8051/` for GPIO handling and timer examples.

## Running the Programs
1. Open the desired `.asm` file in your editor or emulator.
2. Assemble the code, resolve any errors, and link the files.
3. Run the code on your emulator, or transfer it to the hardware if applicable.

Example command for running a file in MASM:
```bash
masm program.asm
link program.obj
program.exe
```
